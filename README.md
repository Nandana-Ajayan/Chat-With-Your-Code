# Chat-With-Your-Code

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent conversational interface that allows developers to interact with a C/C++ codebase using natural language queries. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system will retrieve relevant source code, documentation, or comments and generate meaningful, context-aware answers to user queries. This enhances developer productivity, code comprehension, and onboarding speed.
